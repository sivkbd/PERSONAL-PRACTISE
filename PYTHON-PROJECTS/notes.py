#print("hello world")
#if statement
#if 6> 3:
    #print("six is greater than 3")

#assigning to a variable
# x =2
# y = "hello"
# print(x)
#WHEN YOU SPECIFY THE DATA TYPE ON PYTHON,  USE CASTING
#FOR EXAMPLE

# x = int(4)
# y = float(20)
# z = str("john")

# print(x, z, y)
# print(y)
# print(z)
#we can also get the data type by using type function.
# for example
# a = 45
# b = 49,3
# c = "siviwe"

# print(type(a),type (b),type (c))


#upacking a collection in a list

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "lemon"]
# e,r,t = fruits
# print(e,r,t)

#global variables, when variables created outside of a function 
# but can be used both inside of function and outside 

# name = "siviwe"
# def myName():
#     print(" my name is "+ name)
# myName()

#what happens if the global variable is the same as the variable inside the function.
# surname = "kibido"

# def mySurname():
#     surname = " citywayo"
#     print("my surname is"+ surname)

# mySurname()

# print("my surname "+ surname)
